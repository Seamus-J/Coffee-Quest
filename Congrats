You turn and notice a doorway in the wall, handily labeled exit and think 'I didn't see that there before? How did I miss it?'
You step over to door and prepare to pass through it, but hesitate on the last step. You turn and consider the dungeon, thinking to
yourself 'Have I truly learned everything I needed to? Am I prepared to go on?' With a final decision you turn back to the door and
tell yourself 'Yes, yes I have.' With that final thought you step through the door and exit the dungeon.
